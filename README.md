### Hi!!! I'm Dachi or Aidan (my irl name).

Always coding projects because and for my interests.

- Spent years coding things in Java (for Spigot plugins). This resulted in me being very familiar with Java.
- Small bit in Python for making web scrapers, rest api web servers. 
- Coding in C++ for the performance & use of the ffmpeg api. After getting into it, I ended up loving that low level ability.
