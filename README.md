## Welcome Hi 

I'm Dachi! You can also call me Aidan (my irl name) if you know me personality.

I like to code little projects related to my favorites things! For example web scrapers, radio, audio/video protocols and also protocols for VOD or live streaming content such as HLS or DASH.

Experiences:
- Spent years coding things in Java.
  - This was originally for SpigotMC plugins. I did this a lot of learning how to code & I was a very terrible coder! I've gotten way better. The many years of Java coding resulted in me being very familiar with Java.
- Small bit in Python.
  - Was for making web scrapers, rest api web servers! Was made using terrible multithreading! 
- More current - Lots of C++ Coding!
  - Originally was for better performance than Java and Python and to be able to use the c ffmpeg api. I was nervous at first! After getting into it, I ended up loving that low level ability. My experience with Java really helped.
